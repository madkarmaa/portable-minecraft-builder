A PowerShell script that creates a portable Minecraft installation that you can use from **any Windows PC**, just put it in a USB drive 😉

![separator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

## ❓ Info

This script will download, extract and setup all the necessary tools by itself and delete them after it's done, **no software installation or admin permissions are required**.

It uses 64-bit resources/software, so it's meant for **64-bit Windows only**.

## ❓ How to use

Simply run `portable-minecraft-builder-(win64).bat` (download **[here](https://bit.ly/portable-mc-gui)**). A Graphical User Interface (GUI) will pop-up. Adjust the settings, then click "Install" and let the script do its thing 😉. It will delete all the unnecessary files by itself. Further instructions/information are available at script runtime.

> There's also a [CLI version](https://github.com/madkarmaa/portable-minecraft-builder/tree/master) of this script, but I'm no longer going to update it.

## ⚠️ WARNING

⚠️ **FRACTUREISER** INFORMATION ⚠️

As of **09/06/2023**, a few days ago several mods got infected by a virus, and so I've wanted to include all the security checkers avaiable for the moment since this script installs mods.

> _Several innocent looking malicious mods and plugins were initially uploaded by the malware's creator to the mod hosting website CurseForge and plugin hub dev.craftbukkit.org (not the Bukkit software itself). A high-profile mod pack developer downloaded one of these mods to try out, which infected files in their computer without their knowledge - this included a copy of a working project that would then be uploaded to CurseForge as a seemingly leigimate file, with the virus included._

Check out **[fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser/)** and **https://prismlauncher.org/news/cf-compromised-alert/** for more information.
