A PowerShell script that creates a portable Minecraft installation that you can use from **any Windows PC**, just put it in a USB drive 😉

## ❓ Info

This script will download, extract and setup all the necessary tools by itself and delete them after it's done, **no software installation or admin permissions are required**.

It uses 64-bit resources/software, so it's meant for **64-bit Windows only**.

## ❓ How to use

Simply run `portable-minecraft-builder-(win64).bat` (download **[here](https://bit.ly/portable-mc-gui)**). A Graphical User Interface (GUI) will pop-up. Adjust the settings, then click "Install" and let the script do its thing 😉. It will delete all the unnecessary files by itself. Further instructions/information are available at script runtime.
